Basically, we're getting all multiples from 3 and 5, and
reducing the multiples from 15 (becase otherwise we'd double
count)
To get how many multiples exists, a simple division is enough
To get the sum, we use a ArithmeticProgression
Sum(3 * 1..QT_MULTIPLES), where we can do:
3 * SUM(1..QT_MULTIPLES)
